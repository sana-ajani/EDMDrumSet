# EDMDrumSet
First project of the #JavaScript30 challenge to become more comfortable with HTML/CSS and Javascript

A collection of elements that represent keys on the keyboard, and the sound that corresponds to each. When the user presses the key, the sound is played. 

What I learned:

-CSS transitions allow you to smoothly control when the animation happens. I used an individual "transitionend" event handler for each <div> element instead of using a SetTimeout function in the HTML

-<audio> tag! Pretty basic, but beyond just playing the sound, you can make it a bit more complex with loading and pausing functionality 

---Sounds used from ProducerSpot.com---
